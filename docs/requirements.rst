Installing
==========

This python module originally appeared in `libValkka <https://elsampsa.github.io/valkka-examples/_build/html/index.html>`_, so 
there is an identical copy of it within libValkka.

So, if you have installed libValkka, no need to do anything.

Here we have an identical lightweight copy of libValkka's python multiprocessing part, so you can use
the multiprocessing classes without installing the whole of libValkka (which includes a lot of compiled C++ code
and dependencies on various shared libraries).

Install simply from PyPi with:

.. code:: bash

    pip install valkka-multiprocessing
